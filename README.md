Game Description
JumpyRunner is a fast-paced 2D platformer where timing and precision are everything. You control a character who must leap above obstacles, collecting coins. Each jump requires skill and focus as enemies shift and change positions, keeping players on their toes. The goal is simple—jump, survive, and reach the highest score possible. With smooth movement, simple yet addictive mechanics, and endless replayability, JumpGame challenges players to test their reflexes and push their limits with every jump.
